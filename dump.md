## Ideas
~~survey/ social experiment as a front to talking and getting to know strangers (women)  
	- top interest

	- what would you do if money wasnt an issue, social norms, just dont care  
	- contact num for follow up questions ~~

~~talking to future/past self~~
~~secret md files,public but encrypted,~~
